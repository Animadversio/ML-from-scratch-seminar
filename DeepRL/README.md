# Deep Reinforcement Learning

## Session overview

In the lecture portion, we will cover:

1. Introduction to RL framework
2. Q-Learning
3. Deep Q-Networks
4. Exploration-exploitation tradeoff


In the coding portion, we will implement the Q-learning and DQN algorithms using [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/docs/) and [TensorFlow 2](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide). 
The structure of this notebook is:

1. Introduction to OpenAI Gym
2. Implementing RL algorithms using Gym
3. Training and evaluating a Q-learning agent
4. Training and evaluating a DQN agent


## Resources for learning more

Deep RL is a HUGE field, so we've only touched the surface of it. Here's a list of resouces if you're interested in learning more.


### Helpful blog posts on RL algorithms
- [Lil'Log](https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/archive.html) - For this session, I found her posts [A (Long) Peek into Reinforcement Learning](https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/2018/02/19/a-long-peek-into-reinforcement-learning.html) and [Implementing Deep Reinforcement Learning Models with Tensorflow + OpenAI Gym](https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/2018/05/05/implementing-deep-reinforcement-learning-models.html) really helpful. She also has a post on [Policy Gradient Algorithms](https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/2018/04/08/policy-gradient-algorithms.html)
- Daniel Sieta's posts on [DQNs](https://danieltakeshi.github.io/2016/12/01/going-deeper-into-reinforcement-learning-understanding-dqn/) and [policy gradients](https://danieltakeshi.github.io/2017/03/28/going-deeper-into-reinforcement-learning-fundamentals-of-policy-gradients/)
