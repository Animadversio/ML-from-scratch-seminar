If needed, good for a general introduction to the mathematics and concepts:

The bible of Gaussian Process:
http://www.gaussianprocess.org/gpml/chapters/
Suggested reading is:
(1) Chapter 2, beginning through and including section 2.3 (can stop before decision theory, note useful pseudocode on p. 19)
(2) Chapter 5, sections 5.1, 5.2, 5.4 (5.3 is optional)
But the entire book is excellent and still frequently cited!

They created the GPML software, which is the gold standard if you're using MATLAB:

A great resource for learning about kernels is David Duvenaud's thesis and the kernel cookbook:

(website with reduced content here: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~duvenaud/cookbook/)

This blog has example python code, as well as walkthroughs on some of the best modern software packages:

I have added some reference papers to the 'advanced methods' folder, mostly by the same people developing GPFlow (a 
tensorflow implementation of gaussian processses which uses variational inference and scalable computation to work with
non-conjugate likelihoods and large datasets, automatic differentiation, integrate with deep networks, & more...)
