To give a back-of-the-envelope explanation: The variance of the transition model has to scale with $dt$ in order to keep the integrated white noise scale-invariant. The observation noise covariance scales inversely with the time step: The smaller I make the time step, the less informative a single observation becomes. On the other hand, I also have more observations per unit time, so this scaling prevents oversampling the observations and thus making the inference trivial.
